<h1>Contribute</h1>

hence this project is open source, and that I am a solo developer with not much javascript experience, it would be greatly appreciated if you could help me out by contributing to the project.

<h1>Current Status of the project</h1>

The project is currently not working, the only thing that happens when you install and enable the plugin is a prompt thanking you for installing the plugin. I am figuring out how to make the actual plugin work. But for now this is all that I have done.
